# Verbal-Reasoning-Aptitude-Test
This study focuses on evaluating the syllogistic reasoning aptitude of 63 graduate or masters or class 11-12 students, specifically concentrating on male students aged 18 to 25 years. The primary objective is to analyze the psychometric
properties of syllogistic reasoning items through item analysis, aiming to identify areas for improvement in measuring this cognitive ability. The findings
encompass a variety of item difficulty levels, discrimination indices, and itemtotal correlations. By employing Ebelâ€™s Criterion, several conclusions were
drawn regarding the difficulty and discriminatory power of individual items.
Nevertheless, the study had limitations in terms of sample bias, a restricted
age range, and a small sample size, which limits the generalizability of the
results. Consequently, further research is recommended to investigate gender
differences, developmental trajectories, cross-cultural comparisons, the correlation with academic outcomes, and the effectiveness of interventions and training
programs in enhancing syllogistic reasoning skills.
